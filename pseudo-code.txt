The website should open with a stylish loading page (research how much it is necessary for better experience)

The header should be fixed and change background or color.

The menu should be a modern hamburger menu that opens up elegantly and covers the whole page.
It opens sliding up from the bottom. When hovering on the menu tabs, the rest of the tabs go pale. It can show an image for each menu tab.

The hamburger menu and logo appears when scrolling up.

The main page should have a top part with a fixed background animation and the motto on top of it.
Below that comes the main description/introduction of the product with an image that highlights its unique characteristic. The text appears from the bottom.
Below that, there could be couple of images and text.


The top part of the page has an automatic slideshow that can also be controlled by the user.
On top of that there is the name of the company. It would be nice to have an animation that writes the text in a handwritten way. The images in the slider are shrinking for creating a photo effect.

Scrolling down images and text appear from below. Possibly combined with some nice design elements floating in from the sides.

While scrolling there appears a stylish page navigation on the left.

The background of the product page should be a road and change background on each step.
